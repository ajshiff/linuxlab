* Program:
*    Project 03, Monthly Budget v02
*    Brother Cook, CS124
* Author:
*    Aaron Shiffler
* Summary: 
*    This program gathers and displays budget information given from the user.
*
*    Estimated:  0.5 hrs   
*    Actual:     1.5 hrs
*      Understanding StyleChecker's requirements took me a while to understand.
*      and making sure everything lined up as expected took some time too.
